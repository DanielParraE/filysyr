A cute little project trying to be a file manager.

Please take in to account this project is only for experimentation.

I do not encourage anyone to use this. I have no idea what I'm doing and my brain is pretty small and soft, so most probably this attempt of a project won't be optimized, not because I don't want to, but because I don't know how.

Created with ElectronJS.

^ Picking ElenctronJS was my first mistake apparently...

## Features

- Indexing it's the slowest feature of this thing.
- Show folders, files... and that's it for the moment...
- Show file extension, name and type...

## Work to do

- Change the format for the listing.
- Change the indexing function so it won't take ages to load.
- Change the data format resulting from the indexing.
- Implement a search function.
- Add icons for file type.
- Cry.
- Change the app icon.
- Refactor spahetti code.
